# weather-app

The Weather App is an application that aims to obtain the daily and weekly weather forecast based on the user's current location, which is obtained if the user authorizes it. To obtain data based on the user's location, the [OpenMeteo API](https://open-meteo.com/en) was used. To improve the organization and standardization of the code, the Hexagonal Architecture and the View Model design pattern were used.
